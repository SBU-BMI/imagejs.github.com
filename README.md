#ImageJS

Image analysis in the web browser using JavaScript. Current prototype is best explored in Google Chrome. 

##Availability

Best place to get it is from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imagejs>. You can also point your Chrome web browser to <http://imagejs.org/>, which will open the index.html kept here, i.e. <http://imagejs.github.com/index.html>, which can be inspected at <https://github.com/imagejs/imagejs.github.com/blob/master/index.html>.

##Files
Only two files from this github project are needed to run ImageJS on a different location: index.html and imagejs.js.
