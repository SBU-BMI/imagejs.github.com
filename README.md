#ImageJS

Image analysis in the web browser using JavaScript. Current prototype is best explored in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome Web Browser"). Note [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome Web Browser") does not need Administrative provilidges to be installed.

##Availability

Best place to get it is from [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imagejs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imagejs "to get it as a web app") which will add it as a Chrome App and will make sure Chrome is being used. You can also point your Chrome web browser to <http://imagejs.org/>, which will open the index.html kept here, i.e. <http://imagejs.github.com/index.html>, which can be inspected at <https://github.com/imagejs/imagejs.github.com/blob/master/index.html>.

##Files
Only two files from this github project are needed to run ImageJS on a different location: ***index.html*** and ***imagejs.js***.
